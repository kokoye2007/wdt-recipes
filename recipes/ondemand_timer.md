On-demand timers allow you to get notified when your application is not functioning normally. When a first kick is not followed up by a second kick, you get notified. Great for monitoring irregular tasks.

1. Provide a name for the timer. Forward slashes can be used to provide grouping, for example *development/continuous-integration*
2. Provide a description. The description will be included in alert emails.
3. Select a max-time, every *5* minutes for example.
4. Provide an alert email, this is where alerts will be sent.
5. Save the new timer.

Now your new on-demand timer is ready to use.
