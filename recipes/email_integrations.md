Many 3rd-party solutions such as hosted team chats can be easily used with WDT.io. There is no need for a custom integration with these solutions because they can receive email, WDT.io can send email, and that's all we need to integrate the two. All you need to do is enable email receiving which will provide you with a special email address. Then use this special email address as the alert email for your watchdog timers in WDT.io. WDT.io detects if an email address is used for such an integration and automatically adjusts the content of alert emails so that they're the most useful when viewed on the 3rd-party site.
