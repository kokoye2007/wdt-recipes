curl is an open source command line tool and library for transferring data with URL syntax.  We can use curl to send inbound kicks to WDT.io to be notified when a job failed.

1. Download the curl executable using the [curl Download Wizard](http://curl.haxx.se/dlwiz/?type=bin)
2. Unzip the package to a local directory on the system you wish to monitor
3. Test curl

```batch
c:\curl.exe google.com
``` 

Now you are ready to [sign up](https://wdt.io/signup) and create a new inbound timer on your windows machine.
