Outbound kicks allow you to get notified when your web-application is not reachable. When an expected outbound kick does not reach its target, you get notified. Great for monitoring web sites and other publicly facing web resources.

1. Provide a name for the timer; forward slashes can be used to provide grouping, for example *production/database*
2. Provide a description; it will be included in alert emails
3. Provide a URL; this is the URL that will be kicked by our watchdogs
4. Select a schedule, every *5* minutes for example
5. Provide an alert email, this is where alerts will be sent
6. Save the new timer

Now your new outbound timer is ready to use.
